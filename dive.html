        </h1>
        <p class = "intro"> Water quality is vital for various sectors, 
            including industries, public health, ecosystems, 
            and the environment. This study scrutinizes a specific 
            water source's quality and regulatory adherence, 
            pivotal for drinking, farming, recreation, and industry. 
            Despite existing control mechanisms, persistent challenges 
            stem from pollution and natural variations. Economic and 
            societal development has led to significant water pollution, 
            surpassing ecosystems' self-purification capacity. Technological advancements 
            in sensors revolutionize water quality monitoring, 
            offering real-time data on parameters like pH, dissolved oxygen, 
            turbidity, temperature, and contaminants, 
            empowering decision-makers to protect human health and 
            contribute to broader efforts in sustainable water resource management.

        <h1 class = "turb"> Turbidity Sensor 
        </h1>
        <img class = "dity" src = "Static/Images/turbidity.png">
        <p class = "sens"> Turbidity refers to the cloudiness or haziness 
            of a fluid caused by the presence of suspended particles. 
            It is a measure of how much light is scattered or absorbed by 
            these particles in the water. Turbidity is commonly used as an 
            indicator of water quality, with higher turbidity levels 
            suggesting a higher concentration of suspended solids in the liquid. 
            Monitoring turbidity is crucial in assessing the clarity and 
            potential impurities in water for various applications, 
            including environmental monitoring and water treatment.
